# Alternative implementations for learnings

HuggingFace (`hf`) is highest-level, PyTorch and Tensorflow are lower-level
implementations.

# How to run

- These have separate `requirements.txt`
- First train (to get weights), then infer
- Scripts are ran from root project dir to use `utils.py` and similar. See
  `Makefile` in root
