# Alternative implementations for learnings

HuggingFace (`hf`) is highest-level, PyTorch and Tensorflow are lower-level
implementations.

To run:

- These have separate requirements.txt
- First train (to get weights), then infer
- These are ran from root project dir to use `utils.py` and similar. See
  `Makefile` in root
